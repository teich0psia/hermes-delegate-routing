"""hermes-delegate-routing — explicit per-task delegate routing.

A fork-free Hermes Agent plugin. It lets a batch delegation route each subagent
to a different model/provider/reasoning effort via per-task fields:

    delegate_task(tasks=[
        {
            "goal": "cheap summarize", "model": "gemini-flash-2.0",
            "provider": "openrouter", "reasoning_effort": "low",
        },
        {
            "goal": "careful review", "model": "sonnet",
            "provider": "anthropic", "reasoning_effort": "high",
        },
    ])

Design and rationale live in docs/DESIGN.md. In short: `delegate_task` is
special-cased in the host runtime to bypass the tool registry, so the sanctioned
`register_tool(override=True)` path cannot intercept it. This plugin instead
applies three narrow, idempotent monkeypatches to `tools.delegate_tool` at load
time (schema advertise → capture per-task routing → apply per child). See
docs/DESIGN.md §6 and §6.1.

Only per-task `tasks[i].model`/`.provider`/`.reasoning_effort` is supported
(top-level routing fields are dropped by the host before they reach the tool).
This matches upstream's own recommended `tasks=[...]` call shape.
