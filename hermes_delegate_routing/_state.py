"""Per-call routing state shared between the capture seam (B) and apply seam (C).

The capture wrapper on ``delegate_task`` resolves per-task creds and stashes them
here keyed by ``task_index``; the wrapper on ``_build_child_agent`` reads them
back by ``task_index`` (the only correlation key it receives). A ``ContextVar``
isolates concurrent/overlapping ``delegate_task`` calls (per thread / per async
task) and the build loop runs synchronously within one call's context, so the
index→creds map is stable for that call. See docs/DESIGN.md §6 (Seams B, C) and §9
(concurrency).
